        <p>Establishes the tone, mood, type and scope of the story. 
        Introduces the reader to the genre, world, time frame, age demographic, and tone.
        Also important for introducing the hero before the events of the story.
        The opening image creates a very clear "before" picture, so as the story unfolds, the viewer has context grounded for the after.
        At the end of thhe story, the opening image also provides contrast to <a href="#Fifteen">Beat Fifteen: Final Image</a></li>, or the "after."
        <br><br>The opening image:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduces of the hero</li>
          <li>Define's a clear "before"</li>

      </div>
      <div class="contentRight">
        <p>The "theme stated" introduces the viewer to the overall "why" of the story.
        The thematic premise is usually introduced by a secondary character.
        Focus on the "question" that the story is trying to answer.
        A good "theme stated" will have someone casually ask something like, "what is the point of all this if you can't make any money?"
        That draws the viewer's mind to the question, which the events of the story will later answer.
        <br><br>Theme stated:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduces the thematic premise</li>
          <li>Is usually stated by a supporting character</li>

      <div class="contentLeft">
        <p>Set-up completes the "Before" picture. 
        All of the characters in the A Story must be introduced.
        The A-Story is the main plotline, the biggest picture answer to "What happens."
        The audience needs a clear understanding of what the characters feel is missing, and what their flaws are.
        Focus on primal desires - audiences relate to needs like love, acceptance, revenge, and anger.
        The rest of the story fixes what is missing in their lives.
        Tics will explode, create conflict, and be resolved by the end of the screenplay.
        Think of the set-up as the "Before," which should be mirrored in <a href="#Fourteen">Beat Fourteen: Finale</a>.
        <br><br>The set-up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develops before picture</li>
          <li>Introduce all characters in the A Story</li>
          <li>Identify what the characters want</li>

        <p>The catalyst, also known as the "inciting event," is what forces the character into action.
        Must disrupt the world created in <a href="#Three">Beat Three: Set-up</a>.
        The catalyst works best if it's the result of a choice made by the character that explodes due to a flaw.
        Some catalysts are passive (a knock on the door, an unexpected letter) - but the main character must be presented with a choice.
        <br><br>The catalyst:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forces the character to make a choice</li>
          <li>Transitions from "Set-up" to "Debate"</li>

      <div class="contentLeft">
        <p>The main character must struggle with a choice.
        The question isn't always "what do I do next."
        Sometimes, the debate centers around "can I do what I need to do?" or "how do I do it?"
        The internal struggle provides a break between the dramatic <a href="#Four">Catalyst</a> and the equally dramatic events of <a href="#Six">Break Into Two</a>
        <br><br>The debate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Character struggles about what to do as a result of the catalyst</li>
          <li>The choice can be what to do, how to do it, or uncertainty whether it can be done</li>

        <p>"Break Into Two" is the final departure from the "Old World."
        The hero must decide to go, and that decision must be included in a big break.
        Something "big" needs to happen at this point, in order for the audience to understand where in the story they are.
        The focus shifts from the "before" picture to the wild and uncertain transition in the middle of the story.
          <br><br>Break Into Two:</p>

        <p>If you consider your story's log-line the A-Story, the B-Story is a secondary story that runs alongside it.
        It carries the theme of the A-Story, but is new in scope.
        Often times, there are new characters, who are the antithesis of the old ones.
        Also often used for a love-story, or unlikely friendship.
        The purpose of the B-Story is to provide some relief from the A-Story, while running in parallel.

        <p>The Midpoint of the screenplay provides eiher a false high or a false low point for the story.
        For example, characters win a battle against the enemy, but they redouble later.
        The story shifts significantly - almost like two different ideas.
        However, both ideas are in line with the A-Story.
        Raises the stakes, and serves as the inverse of <a href="#Eleven">All is Lost</a>.

        <p>The antagonists regroup after the "Midpoint."
        Conflict between the hero and their ensemble dissovlves the group, making them vulnerable.
        This is the transition from the <a href="#Nine">Midpoint</a> and into <a href="#Eleven">All is Lost</a>, where the false high or low set up in the Midpoint is beginning to reverse.

        <p>Often labelled "the false defeat," can be summarized by the phrase "It's always darkest before the dawn."
        Previous decisions made by characters result in serious consequences.
        Blake Snyder recommends including a "whiff of death" at this point.
        The whiff of death can be the death of a character, a character contemplating suicide, or a dead plant.
        It serves to remind the audience of the stakes.
